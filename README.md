**Our aim is to build a profitable company that provides value to our customers, suppliers, employees and community.**

Our founder Namit Goel started selling Springtek range of products in 2010 through fabfurnish and brought this revolution in the online mattress industry. With Years of hard work and dedication and growing customers' demand, he diversified into different ranges of mattresses. Today we are selling all kinds of mattresses & furniture related products with proper quality control and strict adherence to customer experience and satisfaction.

Most brands don’t make their own beds or furniture. We do! So we back our best rated mattress with the industry’s top limited warranty — 11 years! In 2020, the company moved into warehousing facilities in Mumbai & Bangalore to expedite deliveries. Our company is committed to sustainable sourcing and now sources all of the latex used in mattresses and toppers from Organic, Fair Trade farmers in Sri Lanka.

Instead of gimmicks, we make real Hybrid mattresses by combining layers of Certified Natural Latex, Foam & Pocket Springs together. Our Latex foam is not just pu foam made from Polyurethane & chemicals but Organic Dunlop Latex processed for a better tomorrow. What we manufacture, we say it Loud with a clear thought process instead of playing with words to make sales. We design and sell simple but high quality products as per their nomenclatures to give you a better today & tomorrow.
